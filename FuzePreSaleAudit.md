# FuzePreSale Smart Contract Audit

**Audit Date:** July 20, 2025
**Contract Version:** Refactored Code

---

## Executive Summary

This audit assesses the refactored version of the `FuzePreSale` smart contract. The previous version had a critical vulnerability in its token calculation and a high-risk gas limit issue in its claiming function.

The refactored contract has **successfully resolved** these issues. The token calculation is now correct, and the new batch-claiming mechanism is robust and secure. The contract adheres to current best practices, properly utilizes OpenZeppelin's secure libraries, and implements sound logic.

**No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities were found.** The contract appears secure and well-architected.

## Audit Findings

| ID | Finding | Severity | Status | Details |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BUG-01** | Incorrect Token Purchase Calculation | **Critical** | ‚úÖ **Resolved** | The calculation now correctly uses `stableCoinDecimalsUnit` derived from a constructor argument, ensuring accurate token distribution. |
| **GAS-01** | Gas Limit Risk in `claimAll` | **High** | ‚úÖ **Resolved** | The `claimAll` function was replaced with `claimMultipleOrders`, which allows users to claim in batches, preventing transactions from failing due to the block gas limit. |

## Security Analysis

### ‚úÖ Strengths

* **Correct Mathematics**: The core `buyToken` function now correctly scales the purchase amount using the appropriate stablecoin decimal value, eliminating the risk of financial loss for users.
* **Robust Claiming Mechanism**: The `claimMultipleOrders` function is a significant improvement, providing users with the flexibility to manage gas costs and ensuring they can always access their vested tokens.
* **Secure Admin Controls**: All administrative functions are properly restricted. The withdrawal functions (`withdrawStableCoin`, `withdrawUnsoldTokens`) use the contract's actual token balance as the source of truth, which is more secure than relying solely on internal counters.
* **Strong Foundation**: The contract correctly uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`, `AccessControl`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `Pausable`, and `SafeERC20` contracts, inheriting their battle-tested security features.
* **Reentrancy Protection**: All functions involving token transfers (`claimToken`, `claimMultipleOrders`) are correctly protected with the `nonReentrant` modifier.

### üìù Recommendations & Informational Points

* **Immutability**: The refactored contract makes the token address immutable after deployment by removing the `setTokenAddress` function. This is a **positive security practice** as it prevents a malicious or compromised owner from changing the contract's core parameters.
* **Event Emission**: The `claimMultipleOrders` function emits a `TokenClaimed` event for each order inside the loop. While this provides excellent granular data, for an extremely large batch of orders, it could slightly increase gas costs. The current implementation is clear and acceptable.
* **Comprehensive Testing**: While the contract appears logically sound and secure, it's crucial to perform comprehensive testing on a testnet to simulate various purchase and claiming scenarios before mainnet deployment.

## Conclusion

The refactored `FuzePreSale` contract is **secure, functional, and well-designed.** The initial critical flaws have been successfully addressed, and the contract's overall robustness has been improved.

This contract follows modern security standards and is considered safe for deployment, pending a final round of comprehensive testing and a formal audit by a professional security firm.

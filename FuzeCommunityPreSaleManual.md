## How it Works: The Storefront & The Vault üè¶

Think of our presale as a two-part system:

1.  **The Presale Storefront (`FuzePresale`):** This is where you purchase your FUZE tokens. It's like a secure, automated cashier that handles all transactions.
2.  **The Time-Locked Vault (`FuzeVesting`):** After your purchase, your tokens are immediately sent to this secure vault under your name. The vault releases your tokens to you over time according to a set schedule.

## How to Buy Your FUZE Tokens üõçÔ∏è

### **Step 1: Choose Your Payment Method**

You can participate in the presale using two popular types of cryptocurrency:
* **ETH** (Ethereum)
* **Stablecoins** (like USDT or USDC), which are always valued at $1.

### **Step 2: Understand the Fair Pricing**

To reward our earliest supporters, the price of FUZE tokens increases as more are sold.
* **Tier 1:** The first 25 million tokens are sold at **$0.015** each.
* **Tier 2:** The next 25 million are sold at **$0.020** each.
* **Tier 3:** The next 25 million are sold at **$0.030** each.
* **Tier 4:** All remaining tokens are sold at **$0.050** each.

**Note:** The contract is smart! If your purchase crosses into a new price tier, it automatically calculates the best possible blended rate for you.

### **Step 3: Make Your Purchase**

When you send your payment to the presale contract, it does the following instantly:
1.  Calculates the exact number of FUZE tokens you've purchased.
2.  If you overpaid, it **automatically refunds the difference** to your wallet.
3.  Registers your total token purchase in the **Time-Locked Vault**, ready for the unlock schedule.

## Your Token Unlock Schedule (Vesting) üóìÔ∏è

Vesting is a process that releases your tokens over time. This is crucial for creating a stable and healthy market for the token long-term. Your unlock schedule begins on the **Token Generation Event (TGE)**, which is the official launch day of the FUZE token.

### **Phase 1: Immediate Unlock at TGE**
On launch day, **10%** of your total purchased tokens become available for you to claim immediately.

### **Phase 2: The 30-Day Cliff**
After the TGE, there is a 30-day waiting period (the "cliff") before more tokens begin to unlock.

### **Phase 3: Daily Unlocks**
After the 30-day cliff, the remaining **90%** of your tokens will unlock for you gradually, bit-by-bit, **every day for 200 days**.

### **How to Claim Your Tokens**
Once your tokens begin to unlock, you can claim them at any time. Simply visit our official website, connect the wallet you used for the presale, and click the "Claim" button. The Vault will send all tokens you've earned up to that moment directly to your wallet. You can claim as often or as little as you like.

## Security & Transparency ‚úÖ

The entire presale is governed by smart contracts that have been audited and secured. The rules are locked in code and cannot be changed, ensuring the process is fair for every single participant. The project team only has limited administrative controls, such as setting the ETH price and pausing the sale in case of an emergency.
